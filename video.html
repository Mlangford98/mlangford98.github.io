<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/258100913">Christmas Time</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user81094999">Matthew Langford</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p> For this project I gathered old footage from 2 years ago of my christmas adventure down the street from my house. The concept for this video was to capture a someones point of view of what christmas in my family would be like. I filmed this using my Canon Rebel T3i with the kit lens and 50mm lens.</p>
